# Order-Confirmation-Email-Processor
I created this project in order to automate the processing of order confirmations into my spreadsheet. Before this, I used to have to do it manually which would take a lot of work.
Uses heavy amounts of REGEX. It's also currently configured to receive emails from Ticketmaster, but with a little bit of tweaking can be used for any company with a standardized emailing format really. Code is Javascript, but I placed the code within Google Apps Script for this.
